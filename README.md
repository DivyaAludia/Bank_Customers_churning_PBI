# Power BI Churn Rate Analysis Project

## Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing churn rates based on various factors such as balance, credit scores, and age. The dataset consists of customer information including products, credit card details, country, etc., sourced from a CSV file on Google Drive. The project involves data cleaning, sorting using Power Query, defining key performance indicators (KPIs), and creating a dashboard to visualize churn rates.

## Data Source
The dataset is obtained from a CSV file hosted on Google Drive, containing information about customers, their products, credit card details, country of residence, and other relevant attributes.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing was carried out using Power Query within Power BI. This involved cleaning the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates. Sorting operations were performed to organize the data effectively for analysis.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Key performance indicators were defined to measure churn rate based on various factors such as:

- Churn Rate by Balance
- Churn Rate by Credit Scores
- Churn Rate by Age

These KPIs were calculated using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Dashboard Creation
An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI to visualize the churn rates and associated metrics. The dashboard comprises various visualizations including:

- Line charts
- Bar charts
- KPI cards
- Filters and slicers for interactivity

These visualizations provide a comprehensive view of churn rates across different segments, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

## Conclusion
This Power BI project offers valuable insights into customer churn rates based on factors such as balance, credit scores, and age. By leveraging data cleaning, sorting, and DAX calculations, along with interactive dashboard visualization, the project enables stakeholders to understand churn patterns and take proactive measures to mitigate customer attrition effectively.
